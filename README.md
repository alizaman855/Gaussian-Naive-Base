# Gaussian-Naive-Base
This is naïve Bayes classifier algorithm machine learning. Naïve Bayes theorem uses Bayes theorem for conditional probability with a naïve assumption that the features are not correlated to each other and tries to find conditional probability of target variable given the probabilities of features. We will use titanic survival dataset here and using naïve Bayes classifier find out the survival probability of titanic travelers. We use sklearn library and python for this beginners machine learning tutorial. Gaussian Naïve Bayes is the classifier we use to train our model.
